.Net Challenge Building a Market data contribution Gateway.
============================================================

Background 
----------
Market data distribution is at the heart of every financial system from pre-trade (pricing) to post-trade (risks computation). 
It is important to have a system that can collect, store, and return these for different scenarios.

We would like to build a Market data contribution gateway, an API based application that will allow users to store, 
retrieve and distribute these market data (e.g.: financial quotes such as FxQuote, Swap’s level, etc.) for different scenario.

Contributing a market data involves multiple steps and entities:

Business users -> Market Data contribution gateway -> Market Data Validation
1. Business users -> Individual who is contributing the market quote.
2. Market data contribution gateway -> Responsible for validating request by requesting the market data validation service, 
storing market data, and returning contribution responses.
3. Market Data validation service: Allows to check the market data contribution rights, format (example: Negative FxQuote), 
legal auditing (Financial regulation framework validation such as MIFID, etc.) and reply with an appropriate response code.

We will be building the Market data contribution gateway and only simulating the Market data validation service component in 
order to allow us to fully test the contribution flow.


Requirements
--------------------
The product requirements for this initial phase are the following:
1. Business users should be able to process a market data contribution through the Market data contribution gateway and 
receive either a successful or unsuccessful response.
2. Business users should be able to retrieve the details of a previously contributed market data.
The next section will discuss each of these in detail.


Process a market data contribution 
----------------------------------------
The market data contribution gateway will need to provide business users with a way to process a contribution. To do this, 
Business users should be able to submit a request to the gateway. A contribution request should include appropriate fields 
such as market data type and the market data itself. Market data could be of any type and structure but to keep it simple 
the contribution should be able to process at least Fx quotes (ex: FxQuote, EUR/USD, bid, ask).


Note: Simulating the validation 
----------------------------------------
In your solution you should simulate or otherwise mock the validation part. This component should be able to be switched 
out for a real validation service once we move to production. We should assume that a validation service returns a unique 
identifier and a status that indicates whether the validation was successful or not.


Deliverables
--------------------
1. Build and API that allows a business user.
a. To process a market data contribution through your Market data contribution Gateway
b. To retrieve details of a previously made contributions.


Considerations 
--------------------
Include whatever documentation/notes you feel is appropriate, this should include some details of assumptions made, areas 
you fell could be improved etc.


Extra mile bonus points (not a requirement) 
--------------------------------------------------
In addition to the above, time permitting, consider the following suggestions for taking your implementation a step further:
- Application logging
- Application metrics
- Containerization
- Authentication
- API client
- Build script / CI
- Performance testing
- Encryption
- Data storage
- Anything else you feel may benefit your solution from a technical perspective.
